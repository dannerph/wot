# wot
The code of this repo was produced for a lecture on "Web of Things and Services".

The code can be run on a [NodeMCU](https://github.com/nodemcu/nodemcu-firmware). As IDE we used [ESplorer](https://github.com/4refr0nt/ESPlorer) and for interaction with the thing [Copper](https://addons.mozilla.org/de/firefox/addon/copper-270430/) (a CoAP firefox plugin) or [thingweb-gui](https://github.com/thingweb/thingweb-gui) could be used.
